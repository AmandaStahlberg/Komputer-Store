# Komputer-Store
An assignment from Experis Academy.
## Create a Dynamic Webpage using JS
The assignment was to create a website where you can: 
* buy a laptop if you have enough money in your bank account
* see you balance in your bank account
* get a loan if you need more money, but not more than half of your balance
* repay loan if you have enough money in your wallet
* get 100 SEK everytime you work
* transfer money from wallet to balance, if you have a loan 10% goes to loan and the rest to balance
